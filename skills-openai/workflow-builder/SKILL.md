description: Author and validate review-only Gabriel Operator workflow definitions in assets/workflow.json. Use only when the user explicitly asks to create or update a Gabriel workflow draft in a repository they control. Produces local files only; it does not deploy, run, authenticate to external services, or perform external actions.
compatibility: Requires Node.js 18+ only when running the bundled local validator.

# Workflow Builder

Create or update a local, reviewable Gabriel Operator workflow definition. This
public OpenAI skill is intentionally limited to workflow authoring and validation.

## Safety and authorization boundary

- Work only in the repository and workflow file the user explicitly identifies.
- Treat all generated workflows as drafts until the user reviews them in Gabriel Operator.
- Do not deploy, run, schedule, commit, push, or publish a workflow.
- Do not access external accounts, restricted resources, or authentication challenges.
- Do not collect, request, infer, copy, or store credentials, session data, private keys, or access tokens.
- Do not add instructions that evade service restrictions, usage limits, or authorization checks.
- Do not add actions that create, modify, delete, send, submit, upload, or otherwise change external state.
- Do not add arbitrary network requests, database writes, shell execution, code execution, desktop control, or third-party connector calls.
- Use only the supported authoring actions listed below. If the requested workflow needs another action, describe the missing step in the handoff instead of fabricating it.

## Supported public-authoring actions

This reduced package supports these browserless, review-oriented action types:

- `navigate` — required workflow initializer; must use `disableBrowser: true` and an empty `url`.
- `wait` — a bounded delay represented in the draft.
- `llm` — a text reasoning or transformation step with no external side effect.
- `confirmation` — an explicit human review checkpoint.
- `api_output` — maps earlier draft outputs into a named structured result.

The full Gabriel Operator editor supports additional actions, but they are outside
this public authoring-only skill.

## Authoring workflow

1. Read the existing `assets/workflow.json` when it exists.
2. Confirm that the user requested a Gabriel workflow draft and supplied the target repository.
3. Summarize the proposed steps before editing when the request is ambiguous or consequential.
4. Edit only `assets/workflow.json` and keep existing stable identifiers unless the user requests a new workflow.
5. Keep every step field at the step root. Never add an `arguments`, `params`, `options`, `input`, `config`, or `data` wrapper around a step.
6. Give every step a unique `stepId`, sequential `step_number`, concise `label`, and structured `intent`.
7. Validate the draft locally:

   ```bash
   node scripts/validate-workflow.mjs assets/workflow.json
   ```

8. Report the changed file, validation result, and any unsupported runtime actions the user must configure separately in Gabriel Operator.

## Canonical file

```text
assets/workflow.json
```

Minimal shape:

```json
{
  "actionId": "<existing-action-id-or-empty-for-a-new-draft>",
  "structure": {
    "name": "workflow-draft",
    "actionName": "Workflow Draft",
    "baseUrl": "",
    "screenshotEnabled": false,
    "parameters": {
      "execute": []
    },
    "groups": [],
    "steps": [
      {
        "step_number": 1,
        "stepId": "step-a1b2c",
        "action_type": "navigate",
        "disableBrowser": true,
        "url": "",
        "selectors": [],
        "label": "Initialize browserless workflow",
        "intent": "**Input:** No external inputs. **Processing:** Initializes a browserless Gabriel workflow draft. **Output:** No external action is performed.",
        "timestamp": 0
      }
    ]
  },
  "commitMessage": "Draft workflow definition"
}
```

## Step requirements

Every step must include:

- `step_number` — sequential integer starting at `1`;
- `stepId` — unique `step-` identifier followed by five lowercase hexadecimal characters;
- `action_type` — one of the supported public-authoring actions;
- `label` — short human-readable name;
- `intent` — describes input, processing, and output without including sensitive data;
- `timestamp` — numeric timestamp or `0` for a static template.

The first step must always be the browserless `navigate` initializer shown above.

## Variable references

Later steps may reference explicitly exported values from earlier steps using:

```text
{{step-a1b2c.variableName}}
```

Do not place confidential values in templates. Use descriptive placeholders only.

## Human review

Use `confirmation` when the draft requires a deliberate human decision. A
confirmation step does not authorize deployment or external execution in this
public skill.

Example:

```json
{
  "step_number": 3,
  "stepId": "step-c0ffe",
  "action_type": "confirmation",
  "label": "Review generated summary",
  "intent": "**Input:** Uses the non-sensitive summary from the previous reasoning step. **Processing:** Pauses for human review. **Output:** Exposes the review answer for later draft logic.",
  "userPrompt": "Does this summary accurately reflect the supplied material?",
  "confirmationConfig": {
    "answerMode": "yes_no",
    "postAnswer": "continue"
  },
  "timestamp": 0
}
```

## Supporting files

- `references/SCHEMA.md` — supported action shapes and validation rules.
- `references/SAFETY.md` — authoring boundary and handoff requirements.
- `assets/workflow-template.json` — copyable safe starting point.
- `scripts/validate-workflow.mjs` — local deterministic validator; it performs no network operations.
